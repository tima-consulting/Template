Slide 1 – Title Slide

Title: Uptime & Heartbeat – API Monitoring
Subtitle: Ensuring Reliability with Elastic Stack

Slide 2 – Introduction

What is Uptime Monitoring?

Ensuring services are available and responsive

Detecting failures before they impact users


Why is it important?

Improves system reliability

Reduces downtime and speeds up troubleshooting




---

Slide 3 – What is Heartbeat?

Definition: Lightweight agent for monitoring uptime

How it works:

Sends requests (ICMP, TCP, HTTP) to services

Reports availability and latency to Elasticsearch

Integrates with Kibana for visualization




---

Slide 4 – Uptime vs. Traditional Monitoring


---

Slide 5 – Heartbeat Configuration

Define Monitors:

HTTP Monitor (for APIs)

TCP Monitor (for databases, services)

ICMP Monitor (for network checks)


Example Configuration (heartbeat.yml):

heartbeat.monitors:
  - type: http
    name: My API Healthcheck
    schedule: '@every 10s'
    urls: ["https://myapi.com/health"]

Slide 6 – Visualizing Data in Kibana

Uptime Dashboard:

Shows service status & response times

Provides historical uptime trends


Alerting:

Configurable thresholds for downtime alerts




---

Slide 7 – Demo: Monitoring an API

Step 1: Install and configure Heartbeat

Step 2: Define API health checks

Step 3: View results in Kibana



---

Slide 8 – Best Practices

Set up multiple monitoring locations

Use different check intervals for critical vs. non-critical services

Integrate alerts with Slack, email, or PagerDuty

Regularly review and refine healthchecks



---

Slide 9 – Q&A

Comprehensive Documentation of the Star Schema Model with a Trade Finance Example

1. Introduction

The Star Schema is a widely used data modeling technique in data warehousing and business intelligence. It is designed to optimize analytical query performance and provide a clear, intuitive structure for business users. This model is characterized by a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables, resembling a star â€” hence the name.

In the context of Trade Finance, where financial institutions provide credit facilities to support international trade, a Star Schema can help track and analyze financial transactions such as letters of credit, guarantees, and export loans across different dimensions like clients, products, countries, and time.

2. Components of the Star Schema

The star schema consists of:

Fact Table: Contains measurable, quantitative data (e.g., financed amount, interest rate, fees).

Dimension Tables: Contain descriptive attributes related to the fact data (e.g., client name, product type, country, date).

4. SQL Schema Definition

CREATE TABLE Client (
    ID_Client INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Client_Name VARCHAR(255),
    Industry_Sector VARCHAR(255),
    Client_Country VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Product (
    ID_Product INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Financing_Type VARCHAR(255),
    Maximum_Amount DECIMAL(15, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE Date (
    ID_Date INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Day INT,
    Month INT,
    Year INT,
    Quarter INT
);

CREATE TABLE Country (
    ID_Country INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Country_Name VARCHAR(255),
    ISO_Code VARCHAR(3)
);

CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    ID_Transaction INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Financed_Amount DECIMAL(15, 2),
    Banking_Fees DECIMAL(15, 2),
    Duration_Months INT,
    Interest_Rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    ID_Client INT,
    ID_Product INT,
    ID_Date INT,
    ID_Country INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (ID_Client) REFERENCES Client(ID_Client),
    FOREIGN KEY (ID_Product) REFERENCES Product(ID_Product),
    FOREIGN KEY (ID_Date) REFERENCES Date(ID_Date),
    FOREIGN KEY (ID_Country) REFERENCES Country(ID_Country)
);

5. Sample Data

INSERT INTO Client VALUES
(101, 'ABC Corp', 'Agribusiness', 'France'),
(102, 'XYZ Ltd', 'Automotive', 'Germany'),
(103, 'Global Traders', 'Technology', 'USA');

INSERT INTO Product VALUES
(201, 'Letter of Credit', 1000000.00),
(202, 'Bank Guarantee', 500000.00);

INSERT INTO Date VALUES
(20230101, 1, 1, 2023, 1),
(20230201, 1, 2, 2023, 1);

INSERT INTO Country VALUES
(10, 'France', 'FR'),
(20, 'Germany', 'DE'),
(30, 'USA', 'US');

INSERT INTO Transactions VALUES
(1, 500000.00, 5000.00, 12, 4.00, 101, 201, 20230101, 10),
(2, 250000.00, 2500.00, 6, 3.50, 102, 202, 20230101, 20),
(3, 1000000.00, 10000.00, 24, 5.00, 103, 201, 20230201, 30);

6. Analytical Queries

Total Financed Amount by Country

SELECT 
    c.Country_Name, 
    SUM(t.Financed_Amount) AS Total_Financed
FROM 
    Transactions t
JOIN 
    Country c ON t.ID_Country = c.ID_Country
GROUP BY 
    c.Country_Name;

Average Financed Amount by Product Type

SELECT 
    p.Financing_Type, 
    AVG(t.Financed_Amount) AS Average_Amount
FROM 
    Transactions t
JOIN 
    Product p ON t.ID_Product = p.ID_Product
GROUP BY 
    p.Financing_Type;

Interest Revenue by Quarter

SELECT 
    d.Quarter, 
    SUM(t.Financed_Amount * (t.Interest_Rate / 100)) AS Estimated_Interest_Revenue
FROM 
    Transactions t
JOIN 
    Date d ON t.ID_Date = d.ID_Date
GROUP BY 
    d.Quarter;

7. Benefits of Star Schema in Trade Finance

Simplicity: Easy to understand and use by business analysts.

Performance: Optimized for large-scale queries and aggregations.

Flexibility: Easily extensible to add new dimensions like currency, channels, or risk ratings.

Integration: Can serve as a foundation for dashboards and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for trade finance operations.


8. Conclusion

The Star Schema is a powerful modeling technique for trade finance data warehousing. It allows financial institutions to monitor trade-related credit, measure client performance, manage risk exposure, and support strategic decision-making. With structured dimensions and aggregated facts, trade finance departments can gain faster insights and ensure regulatory compliance through better reporting.

This example can be further expanded with dimensions like currency, issuing bank, transaction status, or document types to support more complex analysis.

.  dans la table

Good question  — even though we currently know the source is Xx, we’re keeping `so` because:

- Later on, **other sources might be added** (e.g.,  manual uploads).
- This field allows us to **keep the model extensible** without changing the schema in the future.
- It also helps with **filtering and lineage analysis** when debugging or reporting.

So it’s more of a defensive design choice to anticipate future evolutions.

2. dans la table d’audit

Thanks for raising this.

Yes, I considered keeping only `start_date`, but:

- Sometimes having the `end_date` helps to **analyze processing duration** and detect performance issues.
- For long-running imports, it can also help in **alerting or support** (i.e., when the process hangs).

It’s not mandatory for now, but it’s a useful audit trail that costs almost nothing to store.

Thanks , you're right that using an `IdProvider` can help abstract the UUID generation and make it testable.

That said, in this case I deliberately chose to keep it simple:

### 1. It’s a purely technical identifier
- The UUID here is **not part of the domain logic** — it’s a technical surrogate key used for storage and joins.
- There’s **no added business value in testing how it’s generated**.

### 2. Simplicity of the persistence layer
- Adding an interface like `IdProvider` just to call `UUID.randomUUID()` would **add indirection** without real gain.
- The current implementation is **self-contained and works well with JPA lifecycle (@PrePersist)**.

### 3. No need to test UUIDs
- We don’t test `LocalDate.now()` or `System.currentTimeMillis()` either — we trust them.
- Here, the UUID is a **black-box value**, and what matters is that it’s generated when needed, not how.

Of course, if someday we need to customize or centralize ID generation (e.g. prefixing, audit tracking, DB compatibility), we could refactor and introduce an `IdProvider`. But for now, simplicity wins.

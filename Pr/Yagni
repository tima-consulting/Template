Thanks for the suggestion!

In this case, I intentionally avoided adding a  or injecting any extra service because:

- **This field is not critical** and doesnâ€™t need testing (just audit metadata).
- The method is `static`, meant to stay extremely simple and self-contained.
- Injecting a service just to set `LocalDateTime.now()` adds complexity and **violates the simplicity principle** here (YAGNI).

If ever we need deterministic timestamps for tests or business logic, then we can refactor. But for now, I prefer keeping it lean and zero-dependency.

✅ Version concise, claire et argumentée :

Hi team,

Just a quick note on why I preferred using a manual stub over Mockito for this test:

1. **Better readability** – With a manual stub, the test reads like a story. No `.when()` or `.verify()`, just clear behavior.
2. **No coupling to internals** – We don't need to verify specific method calls or call orders. We check observable effects, not implementation details.
3. **Pure Java, no framework** – Manual stubs don’t introduce dependencies (like Mockito) into the domain or test layers. This aligns better with hexagonal architecture.
4. **More control** – I can add counters, simulate exceptions, and capture inputs directly without relying on Mockito-specific APIs.

Uncle Bob would approve 😉

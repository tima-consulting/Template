Thanks , totally valid question.

Right now, the logic is handled in the infra layer **because it's purely technical (data ingestion, storage, audit)** and not yet linked to the application Domain's business rules.

We’re preparing a more proper separation:
- A dedicated **domain layer** will be introduced soon for the .
- That layer will encapsulate business logic and reduce infra leakage.

At this stage, introducing a domain layer would just **add complexity without value**, since we’re still working with raw storage and not reusable business concepts.

Once the domain model is stable, we’ll move the logic progressively from infra to domain as needed.
